344. Reverse String

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters s.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Example 2:
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        c = 0
        for _ in range(len(s)):
            s.insert(c, s[-1])
            s.pop()
            c += 1
